# Solidity-Reverse-Average-Auction
In this auction, the agents provide their costs to complete a particular task. The beneficiary takes all the
input costs and choses the agent whose cost is closest to the average. You can refer to the Simple Auction
and Blind Auction given on solidity documentation to understand the dynamics of auction contracts. Note:
Reverse Auction is many a times used by Government agencies to distribute resources to the private
companies.
